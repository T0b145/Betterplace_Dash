# Betterplace your money

This dashboard should give you a brief overview of ongoing [Betterplace](https://www.betterplace.org) projects and the donation behaviour of others. It is a small private project of mine, because I was curious how donation behaviour changed due to the Covid situaction. I am happy for any recommendations.
